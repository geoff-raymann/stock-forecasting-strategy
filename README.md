# 📈 Stock Price Forecasting & Investment Strategy

This project analyzes historical stock data to forecast future prices and simulate investment strategies. It leverages both statistical (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) models, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate risk and return over time.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Forecast stock prices using **ARIMA/SARIMA** and **LSTM** models.
- Simulate future price movements and portfolio growth using **Monte Carlo simulations**.
- Evaluate performance using financial metrics such as **Sharpe Ratio**, **VaR**, and **volatility**.
- Provide actionable investment recommendations and visualize results in a **dashboard**.
